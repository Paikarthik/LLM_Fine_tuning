# LLM_Fine_tuning  

- What is fine tuning of LLM?   
  Adapting pre trained model to specific task.

- Why fine tuning is necessary?   
  Models are generally trained from the data that is commonly available like web etc. Fine tuning is necessary to provide model with domain specific knowledge.  


## Approaches for Domain Adaptation of LLMs:  

- Prompt Engineering:   
  The practice of designing precise prompts to help artificial intelligence (AI) models produce accurate and relevant responses  

  - LLM is an auto regressive model, the output is of the model is determined by the previous inputs, and the output is again feed as input.  
  - Therefore the output of the model can be altered to desired type by specially curating prompts
